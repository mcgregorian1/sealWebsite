SEALâ€™s fundamental research motivation is to map and characterize global change, and to understand the consequences of these changes for the Earth system and society. We use massive datasets, image time series, data fusion, and advanced statistic to map, monitor, and understand global change. Anthropogenic changes to vegetation (e.g. cropping systems, deforestation, etc.) are of particular interest. These maps and data products are critical inputs to models (e.g. coupled ecohydrologic models) that enable an understanding of the consequences of these changes for water, carbon, and food. Example research questions include: How has the global intensification of agriculture affected freshwater availability? How can we feed a growing population without running out of water? Have tropical deforestation mitigation policies been effective? How is vegetation phenology changing in response to a changing climate?
