Krishna Singh (SEAL Postdoc) won the grand prize and Nick Kruskamp took home an honorable mention in the [2018 NCSU CNR Graduate Research Symposium](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/geospatial/news/2018/02/05/center-scholars-win-three-of-four-prizes-in-research-poster-competition/) poster competition. Krishna’s poster documented his investigation into alternative, water saving cropping strategies for California’s Central Valley. Nick’s poster detailed his work applying cutting-edge machine learning methods to map host species for the sudden oak death pathogen in Oregon. Nick made innovative use of an [anaglyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaglyph_3D) to show the differences between existing maps and his work. Congratulations to Krishna and Nick for their accomplishments.
