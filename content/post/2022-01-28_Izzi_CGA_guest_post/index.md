Our SEAL member Izzi Hinks won last year's Travel Award of [Center for Geospatial Analytics (CGA)](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/geospatial). The award supported her attending the past 2021 AGU Fall conference in New Orleans where she presented her recent research "Monitoring crop development in smallholder farms using remotely sensed time series data augmentation". CGA just published her guest post on their website, check it [here!!!](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/geospatial/news/2022/01/20/efficiently-monitoring-small-farms-from-space/). 

Congrats, Izzi!
