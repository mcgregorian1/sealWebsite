Over the past few weeks SEAL has revamped itself in two significant ways. First, our very own Nick Kruskamp is now officially **Dr.** Kruskamp! He successfully defended his dissertation on 17 December to a large zoom audience, and will soon be taking his talents to [RTI International](https://www.rti.org/), where he will be their newest Research Geospatial Scientist. Did we mention Nick has also worked as an instructor with NC State's new [Data Science Academy](https://datascienceacademy.ncsu.edu/) *while* finishing up his research?! While we're sad to see him go, RTI is very lucky to have someone like Nick on their team.

Second, SEAL had a great time at AGU in New Orleans! Despite the glitches switching from in-person to virtual presenters in every session, everyone had a good time and explored some of the city while being safe and *not* catching covid. In addition to presenting our research, we used our opportunities to network and had some fruitful conversations with different researchers. In fact, one of those conversations has already turned into a guest speaker opportunity for Xiaojie! He will be presenting his AGU research to the folks at [Indigo Ag](https://www.indigoag.com/) later this month.

With the new calendar year underway, we are excited for what the coming months will bring. Here's to a happy, healthy 2022 to you and those you love.

And of course, if you'd like to become part of our journey, we'd be happy to have you! We currently have openings for a [Post-doc](https://ncsu-seal.netlify.app/recruitment/) and a [PhD student](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/geospatial/academics/phd-in-geospatial-analytics/). Note the PhD application closes ~ early February.
