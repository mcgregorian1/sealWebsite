Early this month, Dr. Kunwar Singh, and Dr. Sheila Saia organized a two-day long workshop covering the basics of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in the CGA. The primary goals of this workshop were to train new SWAT users, share ongoing ecohydrological studies, and promote networking between SWAT users at NC State. Workshop attendees (7 graduate students, 3 postdocs, 2 visiting scientists, 1 staff scientists, and attendees from Piedmont Triad Regional Council and Wake Soil and Water Conservation District) learned how to set up, calibrate, validate and post-process SWAT model through hands-on exercises. At the end of the workshop, they established a SWAT user group on Slack to share their research, problems and build a community of SWAT researchers at NCSU.
