With the start of the Fall 2019 term, we’d like to welcome two additions to the SEAL team, Ian McGregor and Xiaojie (J) Gao! Both are new PhD students in the Geospatial Analytics program, and part of a vibrant [new cohort](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/geospatial/news/2019/10/09/i-use-geospatial-analytics-to-fall2019/). If you’d like to find out more about Ian and J, check out our [team page](/people/).
