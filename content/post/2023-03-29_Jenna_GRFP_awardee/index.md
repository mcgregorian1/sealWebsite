Congratulations to our own Jenna Abrahamson for being awarded the 2023 National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship! As per the [NSF GRFP website](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/), "the purpose of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) is to ensure the quality, vitality, and diversity of the scientific and engineering workforce of the United States. GRFP seeks to broaden participation in science and engineering of underrepresented groups, including women, minorities, persons with disabilities, and veterans. The five-year fellowship provides three years of financial support inclusive of an annual stipend of $37,000." 

In her research, Jenna maps daily inundation at high spatial and temporal resolution in North Carolinaâ€™s coastal wetlands by integrating multi-sensor remotely sensed data and physically-based models in a model-data assimilation framework. Her work aims to improve CH4 flux estimates and generate more accurate under-canopy estimates of inundation. [View her poster from the 2022 AGU Fall Meeting](https://ncsu-seal.netlify.app/poster/#gallery-poster_img-6) to learn about the early stages of her work on this project. 

Congratulations, Jenna, on this very well-deserved award and prestigious fellowship!
