We haven't had many posts here because with the return to a mostly-in-person office format, the semester has apparently flown by. That being said, with the return of AGU this year (12-17 Dec), SEAL is excited for a number of us to go to New Orleans in person to present our research using both oral and poster presentations. Though some of us are a bit more interested in the beignets than others (*cough* Josh *cough*), we're all looking forward to having a conference experience as a group, especially as it's the first in-person conference 3 of us!

Because AGU is hybrid, the format is a bit different than pre-Covid. Those of us giving oral presentations, for example, have our recorded talks online for viewing for registered attendees. Then, we will be in person for 5-minute overview lightning talks in our respective sessions. Posters will be both online and in-person. If you're at AGU this year, be sure to watch our presentations and/or come see us in person!

Here is everyone presenting:

**Ian**
- *Title:* We Canâ€™t Have It Both Ways - Accepting the Trade-off of Detection Time and Accuracy in Multi-source, Near Real-time Deforestation Monitoring
- *Session:* B32B-08, Wednesday 15 Dec 10:25 [oral]
- *Overview:* This research provides 3 overall contributions: first, we can combine satellite sensor data by a simple data fusion (as opposed to intensive image fusion), which can potentially allow for faster results when doing near real-time monitoring. Second, similar to what other studies have shown, using a multi-source approach overall improves detection of forest disturbances, there remains some volatility when including Sentinel-1. Finally, trade-offs exist between accuracy and latency in a monitoring context. While our specific values are for our study region, we expect this trade-off principle holds true elsewhere. We suggest in monitoring studies, therefore, that researchers specify their parameter choices and explain why they chose that particular set.
