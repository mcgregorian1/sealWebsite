I am a current first year PhD student within SEAL and the broader Center for Geospatial Analytics at NCSU.
My research primarily focuses on the development of remote sensing algorithms and computation at scale to derive information and new data.
Additionally, I am a firm believer of Open software/science and subsequently enjoy contributing and writing new processing addons for GRASS GIS.
