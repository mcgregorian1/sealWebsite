I am a Geospatial Analytics PhD student. I received my B.S. degree in GIS from Chengdu University of Technology, China, and completed my M.E. degree in natural resources and environmental remote sensing as a joint graduate student from Chengdu University of Technology and Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Besides, I had 3 years of full-time work experience in GIS industry. My PhD dissertation research focuses on understanding the chilling effects on urban plant spring phenology. My long-term research goal is using remote sensing, GIS, machine learning and other advanced technologies to help us understand human-nature interaction and global climate change.
