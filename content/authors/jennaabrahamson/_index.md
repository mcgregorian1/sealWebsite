I am a fourth year Geospatial Analytics PhD candidate within the SEAL lab at NCSU.  My current research interests focus on using remote sensing algorithms to locate and characterize land surface changes across regional to global scales in near-real time.  Additionally, I am also interested in developing methods to map inundation changes in forested, coastal wetland ecosystems and assessing the impact of inundation events on biogeochemical processes related to carbon storage and methane emissions.  More broadly, I have an interest in developing remote sensing methods that use principles from ecological forecasting, Bayesian statistics, data fusion, and machine learning to help us understand changes on earth and their impact on global climate change.
